Artur is very knowledgable and was able to solve all tasks that we asked for. He makes himself available to implement changes and adjustments fast, which helped making the project easier more efficient. Improvement can me made in communication to us in advance for when the job exceeds the estimated timeline. There were also some issues with mobile responsiveness after implemented changes that I think should have been discovered by Artur after making the changes. Besides this, it was an overall positive experience!

There was a lack of communication and understanding with the freelancer
Freelancer's Response
I'm sorry but we responded to your request within 5 minutes. Your response in return took about a 1 day to 2 days to respond, request or any type of responding through the communication portal. It took you sir 3 weeks to mark this job as completed, when it was completed 3 weeks ago. The communication from our end was there just ask any one we work with on here. You also lacked of understanding what you wanted in the project and in your original project statement (description) you lacked to include a lot of elements and details, which you then pressured us to do under the same fee or you would leave bad feedback. Looks like you left bad feedback anyways even though the job wasn't worth $90 for what we did for you. Thank you, it was a pleasure working with you and I hope you treat other freelancer with higher respect in the future, as they treat you.

Integrate Email Service with Signup Form
 3.50  Jan 2014
KWD is a good and fast developer. They fixed my problem and everything is in working order. Unfortunately there was miscommunication which led to a simple project turning into more.

Had KWD informed me of their solution to my problem prior to executing it, I would have not agreed to it as they accessed parts of my website without authorization.

Still, they did end up finishing the project and everything works. I just would have preferred they took a different course of action and consulted me first.
Freelancer's Response
Just to clear it up a little, you authorized us to your entire website since its needed to make modifications. However, since you use default plugin set CSS within everything we had to overwrite half for your form to work. You also forgot to mention a few elements in your project description that we did at no extra cost, well over what anyone would charge you in the end. Description of your project should be accurate rather then us finding out you needed much more then needed. If we integrated the API you would run into future problems more and you would have no control over management. I don't believe we deserve a 3.5 star feedback since in the end, you got more then what your project was described as. -Thank you it was a pleasure working with you.

Moving Wordpress to new server
 4.60  Apr 2012
I am very pleased with the work done.

They completed the migration of my fairly large Wordpress site (with two subdirectory sites) to new server and everything is up and running perfectly. Finished just about on time. Only one minor glitch which required using my backup (IMHO, they should have made a backup themselves before starting work on site). However, they fixed everything within about 1 hour after I pointed out the problem.

Did even more than was spec'ed in original proposal and declined my offer for additional payment.

Emails were answered VERY promptly and courteously.

I would DEFINITELY use them again for future projects.

The reason I hired Kenton was due to the lack of professionalism and reliability of the previous designer I had hired so I was therefore very cautious. Kenton Web Design surpassed my expectations and were excellent at handling my very cautious approach.

If you are reading this review in order to find a quality provider, who is flexible in approach and highly communicative, then look no further. Stop wasting time and get Kenton Web Design on the case.

Watlington Outdoors - Convert existing website to CMS using Wordpress
 4.80  Mar 2011 - May 2011
Overall I am very satisfied with how this project went. I received many responses to my request and picked Kenton Web Design because they were located here in the USA and figured it would be easier to communicate and also keep my US dollars here in the states. They did an awesome job creating a word press version of my existing site. They were very patent with me as they showed me how to navigate around the backend of my new site to make changes and create new pages. I was not able to retain a couple of features my old site had, but also gained some new ones. Their understanding of my complex SEO needs was also appreciated.

My schedule made this project launch later than I wanted, but they worked with me when I was available to make it happen. After we launched, they also responded promptly to some errors that I found and fixed all that I requested within 24 hours which is nice. I signed up for their cloudypress hosting and look forward to continue to work with them. I have no problem referring them.

Transfer iweb site to Wordpress
 4.55  Mar 2011 - Apr 2011
I worked with Interdevil to transfer my iweb site into two wordpress sites. The outcome was great and I have two fully functional sites now.

I received many bids for this project, but was never thrilled when I saw all the portfolios. When Interdevil bid on the project, I loved their design aesthetics and knew I wanted to choose them. It got off to a rocky start when a week after me choosing Interdevil, they wanted to back out of the project realizing there was more time involved than was worth the payment they originally proposed. But we had a fair discussion about it and Interdevil was professional in handling it, which I respected. They decided to keep me on as a client and we moved forward.

They were fantastic at helping me with all the final tweaks and adjustments and was very responsive. I loved how when I wrote a bullet point list of things that needed to be done, I would soon receive a bullet point list of all the things they completed. I would recommend them.
